<h1>The IF Archive</h1>
The IF Archive is the central site on the Internet for text adventures and related interpreters,
compilers and other tools. The Archive has an unrivalled collection of material relating
to text adventures, including something in the region of two thousand games. Formerly at the FTP
site <b>ftp.gmd.de</b>, it is now at the web site
<a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/">http://www.ifarchive.org/</a>.
<p>
The Archive's main collection of Z-code games is in the
<a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXgamesXzcode.html">games/zcode</a>
directory. As the archive contains many hundreds of games, finding one to play can be
daunting: a site that aims to help with this is Mike Roberts'
<a href="http://www.ifdb.tads.org/">Interactive Fiction Database</a>, which provides
information and reviews of games in the IF Archive.
