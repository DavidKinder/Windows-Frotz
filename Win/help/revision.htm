<h1>Revision History</h1>

<b>1.21</b>
<ul>
<li>Support for high DPI and changing DPI with Windows 10: if the DPI is changed
(from the Display settings app, or by moving the window from one monitor to
another with a different DPI) then the interpreter rescales itself appropriately.
<li>The toolbar images have been redrawn for a more modern look.
<li>If Frotz is running an Infocom game that attempts to play a sound effect (that is,
Lurking Horror or Sherlock) but no Blorb sound file can be found, a message comes up
telling the user where to download the sound files from.
<li>Added a Russian translation of the UI by Nikita Tseykovets.
<li>Error messages of the form "@Attempt to address illegal object &lt;n&gt;" now
respect the interpreter's error settings.
</ul>

<b>1.20</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixes for picture colors in Infocom's V6 games, submitted by Stefan Jokisch, have been
made. With these changes borders in Arthur and Shogun change colours as they did on the
original interpreters, and the colours of an ornate initial in Zork Zero have been fixed.
</ul>

<b>1.19</b>
<ul>
<li>Font sizes larger than 28 points can now be selected in the options dialog.
<li>The implementation of the <b>print_table</b> opcode now behaves sensibly when called for
the lower window: the contents of the table are printed to the lower window with a carriage
return after every row in the table except the last.
</ul>

<b>1.18</b>
<ul>
<li>The Blorb resolution chunk ('Reso') is now supported, allowing graphics in V6 games to be
scaled appropriately for the interpreter's window size. For Infocom's V6 games this scaling
is done as a simple, 'blocky' rescale (producing a result that matches the original appearance
of these games), but for other games this is done with a proper rescaling algorithm that
produces smooth results.
<li>The <b>V6 scaling</b> item in the options dialog has been removed: when running an Infocom
V6 game the interpreter automatically resizes the window to the largest multiple of 320x200
that fits on the screen.
<li>If the game calls the <b>restore</b> or <b>save</b> opcodes in the form that does not
bring up a file dialog, the interpreter now takes care to remove any characters which would
change the directory in which the file is written.
<li>A case where the <b>check_unicode</b> opcode would report that a character could not be
printed, when in fact it could, has been fixed.
<li>The <b>output_stream</b> opcode did not correctly handle its width argument in V6: this
has been corrected by a patch from David Griffith.
</ul>

<b>1.17</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a long standing bug which led to incorrect Quetzal save files being produced when
a Blorbed game file is loaded into the interpreter. The save files worked with previous
versions of Windows Frotz as the bug was present in both the loading and saving logic, but
such save files could not be loaded into other interpreters.<br>
Unfortunately, fixing this bug means that loading old Windows Frotz saved files when running
a Blorbed game is broken, as it is not possible to automatically detect old Windows Frotz saved
files. To work around this, old saved files can be renamed to end with ".badsav", which causes
the interpreter to load them with the old, incorrect logic. The game position can then be
re-saved as a correct Quetzal save file.
<li>The <b>get_prop_len</b> opcode now returns 0 when its argument is 0, as required by the
<nobr>Z-Machine</nobr> Standard Version 1.1.
<li>Transcript files are now written out encoded as UTF-8, allowing non-ASCII characters to be
represented, rather than being replaced by a question mark.
<li>Unicode characters now appear correctly in the scrollback dialog, provided that the dialog
font supports them.
<li>Corrected a problem which could result in the options dialog using the wrong font.
</ul>

<b>1.16</b>
<ul>
<li>Added support for speaking the game's text using Microsoft SAPI 5. This is controlled
by the options on the new "Speech" page of the options dialog.
<li>Updated several links on the Help / Internet Links menu.
</ul>

<b>1.15</b>
<ul>
<li>The implementation of the algorithm for scaling the images in the <b>About This Game</b>
dialog has been sped up.
</ul>

<b>1.14</b>
<ul>
<li>Increased an internal buffer size, as the default size was leading to an interpreter
crash with a very wide display and a small font.
</ul>

<b>1.13</b>
<ul>
<li>Improved the logic used to output Unicode text: now if a character can be drawn in
any font on the system, that font will be used where needed. For best results a 'Unicode'
font (e.g. "Arial Unicode MS" or "Code 2000") should be installed, though it doesn't need
to be selected as either the proportional or fixed width font.
</ul>

<b>1.12</b>
<ul>
<li>Improved margin logic for non-V6 games.
<li>Updated to the latest version of ModPlug, which is now compiled into the interpreter.
</ul>

<b>1.11</b>
<ul>
<li>Added an option to say whether, for a game with an iFiction record, the <b>About This Game</b>
dialog is never shown, only shown the first time a game is loaded, or shown every time.
<li>Added an option to set the user name that is copied into the game's header. This is only used by
a few test versions of Infocom's games.
<li>When saving or loading files, an appropriate file extension is appended if the user enters
a file name without an extension (for sample, ".sav" will be appended for saved games).
<li>Minor improvements to the interpreter's appearance under Windows Vista.
</ul>

<b>1.10</b>
<ul>
<li>Changed the interpreter to first read the Blorb 'Fspc' chunk to find cover art,
in preference to looking in the iFiction metadata.
</ul>

<b>1.09</b>
<ul>
<li>Added support for "The Treaty of Babel" iFiction metadata format in Blorb files. This is
the metadata format that Inform 7 uses.
<li>Added the menu item <b>Help/About This Game</b> which, when playing an appropriately
packaged Blorb file, shows a dialog with the cover art and description of the game. This dialog
is also shown the first time a game is played in Windows Frotz.
<li>Added support for Ogg Vorbis music, based on code submitted to Windows Glk by David Moreno.
<li>Finally renamed the interpreter to just <b>Windows Frotz</b>.
</ul>

<b>1.08</b>
<ul>
<li>The file extensions <b>.zlb</b> and <b>.zblorb</b> are recognised for Blorb files containing
<nobr>Z-code</nobr>.
<li>If the game is in a Blorb file containing Inform 7 metadata, then the metadata is used to determine
the title of the game, as displayed in the title bar.
<li>The size of the <nobr>Z-Machine</nobr> stack has been greatly increased, as games compiled by Inform 7
tend to use substantially more recursion.
<li>Added an option to set whether the text written to the script file is wrapped or not.
</ul>

<b>1.07</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused Frotz to produce Quetzal format save files with incorrect values for
all local variables in the game.
</ul>

<b>1.06</b>
<ul>
<li>Put back the original icons, due to popular demand. The true colour icons are still available
in the program, but you'll have to set them up yourself with Windows Explorer.
<li>Added a French translation of the UI by Jean-Luc Pontico.
<li>Implemented the <nobr>Z-Machine</nobr> Standard Version 1.1. This adds a number of
new features to the Z-Machine, including true colour and background transparency support.
<li>The <b>encode_text</b> opcode now correctly encodes space and caret characters.
<li>For all Z-Machine versions other than V1, Z-character 7 of row 2 in the alphabet table is now
always the newline character, as required by &sect;3.5.5.1 of the Z-Machine specification.
<li>The default foreground and background colour values in the header are now set correctly for V6 if
the colours chosen in the options dialog match any of the standard Z-Machine colours.
</ul>

<b>1.05</b>
<ul>
<li>Added true colour icons drawn by Javier San José.
<li>Changing the input language with Windows' Language Bar (part of Advanced Text
Services) now works.
<li>A crash when using the options dialog after the game has finished has been fixed.
</ul>

<b>1.04</b>
<ul>
<li>Transcript log files now end in <b>.log</b> by default.
<li>Added a new <b>Help/Internet Links</b> sub-menu, containing links to some relevant web sites.
<li>Added an option to disable Frotz from registering itself as the default application for Z-code files.
<li>Added support for some of the more common GNU Readline editing keys during input.
<li>Added a field to the status bar, showing the Z-code version number of the currently loaded game.
<li>OpenType and Postscript Type1 fonts can now be used, providing the version of Windows that Frotz
is running on supports them.
<li>Corrected the the notification routine that is called after a sound finishes playing. This stops
the game <b>Zen Speaks!</b> from locking up the interpreter.
<li>The Expand Abbreviations option no longer breaks 'z' in V4+ games.
</ul>

<b>1.03</b>
<ul>
<li>The window can be made to fill the entire screen; press <b>Alt+Enter</b> to toggle this full screen mode on and off.
<li>Added options to set left and right margins.
<li>Added an option to scroll text as fast as possible.
<li>Added an option to control whether or not <b>[More]</b> prompts are shown.
<li>The <b>Report errors</b> option now defaults to <b>Never</b>.
<li>Frotz attempts to register file associations with Windows, so that double clicking on a Z-code file
starts the interpreter.
<li>The cursor now puts back what was under it when it is removed.
</ul>

<b>1.02</b>
<ul>
<li>Added a field to the status bar, showing how long the current game has been playing.
<li>Added a new menu item <b>File/Stop Playback</b>, which, if a recorded script is being played back, stops the playback.
<li>The scrollback dialog now opens at the end of the text, not the start.
<li>The <b>read_char</b> opcode now returns the correct value if a timeout occurs.
<li>Fixed a problem which stopped font anti-aliasing from occuring on some Windows 9x systems.
</ul>

<b>1.01</b>
<ul>
<li>Added a Spanish translation of the UI by Javier San José.
<li>Added .dat and .zip as file extensions for Z-code games to the New Game file dialog.
<li>The new window size is now written into the game's header when the window is resized.
<li>The Expand Abbreviations option no longer breaks those abbrevations in V4+ games.
<li>Fixed serious problems with save, restore and restart for Z-code games in Blorb files.
<li>Fixed problems with games in directories with very long names.
<li>Fixed incorrect display of accented characters in the translated versions of the [Hit any key to exit.] message.
</ul>

<b>1.00</b>
<ul>
<li>First release.
