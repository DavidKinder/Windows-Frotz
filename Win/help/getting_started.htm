<h1>Getting Started</h1>
In order to use Windows Frotz, you will need a <a href="zcode.htm">Z-code</a> story file to play on it.
This format was originally invented by <a href="infocom.htm">Infocom, Inc.</a> for the games they released
during the 1980s.
<p>
Members of the current interactive fiction community have written many games using Graham Nelson's
Z-Machine compiler Inform, all of which can be played using Windows Frotz. These games can be
downloaded from the <a href="archive.htm">IF Archive</a> at<br>
<a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXgamesXzcode.html">http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXgamesXzcode.html</a>
<p>
When Windows Frotz is first started, a file dialog opens, prompting you for a game file to load.
This file can be either a <nobr>Z-code</nobr> file or a <a href="blorb.htm">Blorb</a> file. A <nobr>Z-code</nobr>
file usually has a name ending with <b>.zn</b>, where n is a number indicating the <nobr>Z-code</nobr> version,
e.g. <b>.z5</b>. A Blorb file contains multimedia resources for games, and can also contain the <nobr>Z-code</nobr>
for the game as well. Blorb files containing only resources have a name ending with <b>.blb</b> or <b>.blorb</b>; those
also containing the <nobr>Z-code</nobr> game have a name ending with <b>.zlb</b> or <b>.zblorb</b>.
<p>
The file dialog also has a check box for selecting the format used to save and restore game positions in. Unless
you need to load game positions saved in an old version of Frotz, it is recommended that you leave this check box
selected. This will cause Windows Frotz to use the Quetzal format for saved positions, which allows a saved
position to be loaded into any Quetzal supporting interpreter on any platform.
<p>
Once a game file is selected, Windows Frotz will open its main window and start running the
game. If the game is packaged with an iFiction record, then the cover art and description is shown first.
