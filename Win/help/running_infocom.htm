<h1>Running Infocom Games</h1>

If you obtain one of Activision's compilations of the Infocom games on CD, or one of the original Infocom
releases, then the games can be played by loading the <nobr>Z-code</nobr> file into Windows Frotz. For
all but the V6 graphical games, this is the file ending in <b>.dat</b>. For the V6 games, the <nobr>Z-code</nobr>
file is the one ending in <b>.zip</b> (which is not to be confused with the zip archive format used by such
programs as WinZip).

<h2>Games with Sound</h2>

The Amiga release of <b>The Lurking Horror</b> and the Amiga and Macintosh releases of <b>Sherlock</b>
both play sounds at points in the game.
<p>
In order to hear the sounds, the first step is to make sure that the <nobr>Z-code</nobr> game file is one of the
releases that supports sound. This can be checked by looking at the release number that the game prints
when it is first started in Windows Frotz: Releases 219 and 221 of <b>The Lurking Horror</b> and
release 26 of <b>Sherlock</b> support sound. If your <nobr>Z-code</nobr> game file is not one of these releases
then patches are available to convert it to a suitable release at
<a href="http://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/patches/">http://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/patches/</a>
<p>
Windows Frotz does not support the sound files as originally released by Infocom. Kevin Bracey
has converted these files into the Blorb resource format. The files can be downloaded from
<a href="http://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/media/blorb/">http://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/media/blorb/</a>
<p>
Make sure that the Blorb sound resource file has the same name as the <nobr>Z-code</nobr> game file (except for the
<b>.blb</b> extension) and then simply load the <nobr>Z-code</nobr> game file into Windows Frotz. You can test
that sound is working by entering
<pre>
  blow whistle
  wait
</pre>
as the first two commands in <b>Sherlock</b>.

<h2><a name="graphics"></a>Games with Graphics</h2>

Infocom's last four games (<b>Arthur</b>, <b>Journey</b>, <b>Shogun</b> and <b>Zork Zero</b>) were all released
using an updated version of the Z-Machine, V6. This allowed these games to contain more elaborate graphics than
previous Infocom games.
<p>
Windows Frotz does not support the graphics files as originally released by Infocom. Kevin Bracey has
developed extensions to the Blorb resource format to allow the Infocom graphics to be converted into Blorb files,
which can be downloaded from
<a href="http://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/media/blorb/">http://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/media/blorb/</a>
<p>
Make sure that the Blorb graphics resource file has the same name as the <nobr>Z-code</nobr> game file (except for
the <b>.blb</b> extension) and then simply load the <nobr>Z-code</nobr> game file into Windows Frotz.
<p>
In addition, the Atari ST version of <b>Beyond Zork</b> came with a title picture. This picture has been converted
to PNG and packaged into a Blorb file, which is available at the link given above for all the other Blorb files. If
this Blorb file is present then Windows Frotz will show the title picture when <b>Beyond Zork</b> starts.
